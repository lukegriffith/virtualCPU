1 - RXY - Load register R with the bit pattern in memory cell XY.
2 - RXY - Load regiser R with the bit pattern XY.
3 - RXY - Store the bit pattern in register R at memory cell XY.
4 - 0RS - Move the bit pattern in register R to register S.
5 - RST - Add (two's complement) the bit patterns in registers R and S. Put the result in register T.
6 - RST - Add (flaoting point) the bit patterns in registers R and S. Put the results in regiser T.
7 - RST - Or the bit patterns in Regiseters S and T. Put the result in register R.
8 - RST - And the bit patterns in registers S and T. Put hte result in register R.
9 - RST - Exclusive OR the bit patterns in registers S and T. Put th result in regiser R.
A - R0X - Rotate the bit pattern in register R one bit o the right X times.
B - RXY - Jump to the instruction at memory cell XY if the bit pattern in register R is equal to the bit pattern in register 0.
C - 000 - Halt.
